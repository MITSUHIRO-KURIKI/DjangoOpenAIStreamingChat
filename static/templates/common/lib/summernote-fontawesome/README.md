Using FontAwesome in Summernote, again
======================================

This plugin replaces icons in Summernote toolbar with [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 


USAGE
-----

 1. If you're using bower, then just type `bower install summernote-fontawesome`
    or download and copy `summernote-fontawesome.js` to your directory.

 2. Embed `summernote-fontawesome.js` into your page below `summernote.js`.

 3. D O N E


NOTICE
------

 - Summernote had used FontAwesome as default icons until its version 0.8.0.
   Since then, it uses own `svg` based font. It has much smaller size than FontAwesome.
   But some Summernote plugins were built on FontAwesome. So I made this for those.

 - This only affects on the toolbar of Summernote, not on popovers.
 
 - Be sure to embed FontAwesome manually.
